 TODO:
  - model validation
    - abstract methods
    - interfaces
  - Slot map() and relate() methods
  - more docs
  - Axiom ordering/priority
  - The defineProperty() and setPrivate() pattern is used in several spots, maybe make a helper function
  - Move types.js earlier?

 ???:
  - ? proxy label, plural from Class to Model

 Future:
  - predicate support for getAxioms() methods.
  - cascading object property change events
  - should destroyables be a linked list for fast removal?
    - should onDestroy be merged with listener support?
  - multi-methods?
  - Topic listener relay
