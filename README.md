## Feature Oriented Active Modeller

Foam is a Modeller: describe your data's properties, methods, event topics,
listeners, dependencies, etc., and Foam will generate your javascript classes.
Use them with Foam's data access layer for easy offline support and pick your
favorite front end framework.

While Foam is written in Javascript, it can be used to generate code for any
language or platform. Android and iOS Swift support are on the way.

## Developer Setup

* Install nodejs.

* Run 'npm install' in the root of the Foam repository, where package.json is found.

## Testing

* _npm test_ runs standard unit tests.

* _npm run testDebug_ runs the unit tests with a debugger.

* _npm run coverage_ runs code coverage and creates an html report in /coverage.

For in-browser testing, run your favorite web server at the root of the Foam
repository. In a browser, navigate to
[http://localhost:8000/test/browser/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8000/test/browser/SpecRunner.html)
to run the unit tests.

## Documentation

* _npm run doc_ generates HTML API documentation in doc/gen/.

Documentation is created by JSDoc with a plugin to account for Foam's package
structure and declarative nature. JSDoc modules correspond with Foam packages.
See [./doc/Documentation.md](./doc/Documentation.md) for information on comment
formatting.
